ECS loggers are formatter/encoder plugins for your favorite logging libraries.
They make it easy to format your logs into ECS-compatible JSON.

The encoder logs in JSON format, relying on the default
https://github.com/uber-go/zap/blob/master/zapcore/json_encoder.go[zapcore/json_encoder] when possible.
It also handles the logging of error fields in
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/ecs-error.html[ECS error format].

By default, the following fields are added:

[source,json]
----
{
  "log.level": "info",
  "@timestamp": "2020-09-13T10:48:03.000Z",
  "message":" some logging info",
  "ecs.version": "1.6.0"
}
